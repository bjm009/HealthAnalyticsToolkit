# Test Plan

This tool is unique in that the tool is successful as long as others are able to view, understand, and following the links provided within the toolkit. This was tested by ensuring others were able to open and view the content successfully with with GitHub pages link. The testing was successful for people within the Georgia Tech system. Currently, since it is hosted by a GT GitHub, external users are unable to view the content. Future works may need to migrate it to a different GitHub page where all public members can view, even outside the GT network.
