# Design Doc for Health Analytics ToolKit

## Problem
The ability to quickly and accurately analyze health data has become even more paramount in the past year. With the pandemic, there has been an added urgency for data analytic tools as engineers, scientists, and doctors are constantly learning and investigating the virus. With the possibility of rapid deterioration for COVID-19 patients, physicians need all the tools possible at their disposal to determine the best treatment option. This means finding ways that technology can help us work smarter and faster!

Resources for programming resources and languages useful for those in the field are not consolidated and can be difficult to find. At times, language basics and simple resources can take a deep internet dive to find, which wastes valuable time and resources. 

## Solution
Due to this dire need for succinct and informational resources, I created a Health Analytics Toolkit deployed via GitHub Pages. The Toolkit containing useful resources in the form of written tutorials,  video tutorials, and external resource links for Python, R, SQL, and MongoDB.

### ToolKit
The toolkit is hosted by GitHub Pages. GitHub houses the markdown files that create the viewable pages. Within the pages, there are written and video tutorials. 

### Video Tutorials
#### Video Tools 
The video tutorials were with some tools specific to the language and some overarching for all videos. The overarching tools include:
* OBS for recording my screen 
* Mobile IOS Voice Memo application for voice recording
* Microsoft Windows Video Editor for editing the video and audio content
* YouTube was used for video hosting

#### Programming Tools 
Tools specific for the independent languages include:
* Command Prompt for Python
* SQL Notebook for SQL 
* RStudio for R
* MongoDB Compass of MongoDB
