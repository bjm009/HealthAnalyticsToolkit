# Welcome to SQL!!

SQL is short for Structured Query Language and is designed for structuring and accessing databases. It works by understanding and analyzing the data fields in their tables. 

For the tutorials and examples provided I will be utilizing [SQL Notebook](https://sqlnotebook.com/index.html), which is a free Windows application. If you would like to use the same application, I recommend exploring their website, documentation, and resources!
