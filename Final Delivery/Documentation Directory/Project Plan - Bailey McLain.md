## Project Tasks

### Task 1 - Understanding the Problem
Task 1 involves investigating the problem and understand the end user requirements. The aim is to work to understand the gaps in the current solutions and the problems being faced with existing resources. 

### Task 2 - Creating a Solution 
Task 2 entails the creation of content for tool kit in the form of short videos as well as written tutorial. For the videos, data has shown that the optimal length for a lesson video is up to 12 minutes. After 12 minutes there is a sharp decline in engagement  Therefore, the aim will be to cover each topic in a single or multiple video tutoritals that are less than 12 minutes long. This task will take the majority of the time allocated for the project. 

### Task 3 - Deploying the Solution
Task 3 encompasses the deployment of the solution, which will include a variety of video and written tutorials. The deployment is highly important to make the materials easily accessible and utilized for scientists, engineers, and researchers.
